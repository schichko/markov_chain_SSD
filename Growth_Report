Our project is a markov chain, a algorithm that takes in a peice of text and sees what words are likely to appear to other words and then generates a sentance or multiple sentances based on length and random probablity.

2. 
In the same folder you are running the markov file you must have any text file and name it sample.txt. We used a text file of romeo and julliet
First you compile the program using:
g++ markov.cpp -o markov
Then you run the program 
./markov

I worked with Jack Maloy. We both put in a very similar amount of hours regarding figuring out how we would code the algorithm itself. I since this was only a group of 2 people I would say we had very similar roles

Around 10. I believe around 8 hours were spent initally coding the project and then an additional 2 for checking for memory issues and making sure there were no errors in valgrind

I hope to eventually get something like this working as a twitter bot, I just think it would be a cool project however I did not have the time to do it this week

Great project! I am someone who has always been very intrested in artifical intelligence and although this is not quite that intelligent, it is an intresting way to look at speach recognition because all it really is, is seeing what words to use after other words. I hope to keep the knowledge of what a markov chain is and use it in other projects.
